This is the loot generation API for dotNetRogue. Made for the individual project of Fontys' FHICT study. 

For the confirmed most stable version, please check stable. Master is where every feature *should* work properly in conjunction with the other features, albeit I haven't tested it yet. 

**Please check the "Requirements" project board to see progress**
